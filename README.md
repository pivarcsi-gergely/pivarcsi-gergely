Hi, I’m @pivarcsi-gergely, aka. Pivarcsi Gergely Máté!I'm from Hungary, and I'm 19 y/o.

I’m interested in and in the future want to become a gamedev (if my attempt at a professional Valorant carrier will fail).

I'm also a vocational student at Petrik Lajos Bilingual Vocational School of Chemistry, Environmental Protection and Information Technology, studying software engineering.

Most of the repos I push here are the works I did at school (if this sentence makes sense and is grammarly correct). I speak both English and Hungarian (more or less at the same level).

I have a Discord, you can reach me there: Startear#1930 (just state why you want to reach me)
